Problem 1
I took the data from the table that was given on the actual assignment page and i threw the information into a csv file and imported the newly created CSV file into my google colab project, i took that data set and i cleaned it by separating the people that were frail and not frail into separate data tables and saved them as new CSV files.

I also ran some models just to look at some of the trands in the data
