I took the data from the table that was given on the actual assignment page and i threw the information into a csv file and imported the newly created CSV file into my google colab project, i took that data set and i cleaned it by separating the people that were frail and not frail into separate data tables and saved them as new CSV files.

I also ran some models just to look at some of the trands in the data

This one showing the count of how many Frail vs Not Frail we have in the data

A correlation heat map with all the data

And also the correlation between hight and weight





<h2>Question 2</h2>
I did a few things with my data here, the first thing i did was i wanted to try and one hot encode the data set and i was able to do that an save it as a new cleaneddata.csv file that is saved in my branch. I have added a photo of it below.

and this is the code i used in order to do that

Then i did a few different models as you can see them below

This was just an inital heat map of the uncleaned data as i was just curious to see if the data raw could show us anything

This is comparing average scores of males on one side and females on the other side

These 2 are box plots that show the score distribution on 2 elements, first being test prep course completion and second being the race/ethnicity

This here is a violin plot that shows the grade distribution based of each score based on the parents highest level of education

Next i did a basic one that showed us how many females vs males there were in our data set as seen above

I did one where i did a stacked bar graph that would show us how many of each gender is on what lunch plan

Lastly I did a box plot showing the average score based on students that were on free and reduced lunch vs the standered lunch plan
